;PROTEUS-ISIS DEFAULT POWER RAIL CONFIGURATION
;
; *** Do not edit this file unless you are sure you know what you are doing! ***
;
;This file specifies the default rails and net bindings that will be used for new designs
;Please note that for any incomming designs which are specified to 'use default power rails connections',
;any connections specified within this file will be applied automatically, irrespective
;whether the PWRRAILS.INI on the machine on which the design was created specified such connections.
;
;For example, if you deleted the binding 'VDD=VCC/VDD' from your PWRRAILS.INI and then loaded one
;of your designs on a machine with the default version of the file, ISIS would automatically connected
;the VDD net to the VCC net, even if it was not wired on your schematics.
;
;Consequently, we recommend that you do not edit these defaults if you plan to exchange
;designs with other users.
;
;However, a design which has been set up NOT to use defaults will not be affected by another
;users PWRRAILS.INI.
;
;

;The rails section specifies default voltages and ARES strategies for each listed power rail.
;We have chose these rails so that most microprocessor and logic circuits will simulate and route
;without need to add voltage sources or batteries to your designs.
*RAILS
VCC/VDD=5.0,POWER
GND=0,POWER
VEE=-5.0,POWER

;The bindings section specifies default connections from nets to power supplies.
;Note that this means that the netnames VCC,VDD abd GND,VSS are assumed to be interconnected by default.
*BINDINGS
VCC=VCC/VDD
VDD=VCC/VDD
VSS=GND
GND=GND
VEE=VEE
